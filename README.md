# 🔐 Real-Time Cyber Risk Scoring & AI-Driven Underwriting (FinTech Research)

## 📌 Project Overview
This research paper explores the application of real-time cyber risk scoring and AI-driven analytics to modern cyber insurance underwriting. The project examines how continuous data ingestion, machine learning models, and real-time threat intelligence can transform cyber insurance from a reactive reimbursement mechanism into a proactive risk management and prevention tool.

The paper evaluates the limitations of traditional, point-in-time underwriting methods and proposes a dynamic framework for continuously quantifying cyber exposure in an increasingly volatile threat landscape.

## 🧠 Research Focus & Motivation
Cyber insurance underwriting has historically relied on static questionnaires, infrequent assessments, and backward-looking indicators. This approach struggles to account for:
- Rapidly evolving attack vectors
- Changing firm-level security postures
- Nonlinear and correlated cyber risks

This project investigates how real-time data and AI-based risk scoring can address these challenges by enabling continuous monitoring and adaptive pricing.

## ⚙️ Conceptual Framework

### Data Categories Analyzed
The paper identifies three core categories of data that drive real-time cyber risk scoring:
- **Attack surface visibility** (external exposure, open ports, configurations)
- **Vulnerability management performance** (patching cadence, known CVEs)
- **Machine learning–based breach forecasting** (pattern recognition, probability estimation)

These data streams are continuously updated to reflect a firm’s true, current cyber risk profile.

## 🤖 Role of AI & Machine Learning
The research discusses how machine learning models can:
- Quantify breach likelihood dynamically
- Detect risk trends before incidents occur
- Support continuous repricing and underwriting adjustments
- Reduce information asymmetry between insurers and insured firms

This approach aligns cyber insurance pricing more closely with real-time risk rather than static assumptions.
